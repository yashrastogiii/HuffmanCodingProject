# HuffmanCodingProject
 This project implements Huffman Coding, a popular compression algorithm, using Java. Huffman Coding is used to reduce the size of data by assigning shorter codes to more frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent ones. This project features a Java Swing-based graphical user interface (UI) that allows users to input text, compress it using Huffman Coding, and then decompress it to verify the compression.

Features

Text Compression: Efficiently compresses text files by encoding characters with variable-length codes based on their frequencies.
Text Decompression: Decompresses encoded text back to its original form, ensuring data integrity.
Interactive UI: A user-friendly graphical interface built with Java Swing, facilitating easy text input and output display.
